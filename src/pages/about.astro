            God is not silent—He delights to speak to His people. From the opening pages of Scripture to the present day, the Lord has revealed Himself in ways that guide, comfort, and correct us. Yet His voice is not always dramatic or loud; often, it comes through ordinary means that invite us to listen with faith and discernment. This devotional explores five key ways God speaks—through His Word, His Spirit, His people, our God-given wisdom, and the circumstances of life—reminding us that His guidance is both personal and purposeful.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
              God gave us minds to reason and discern. While faith is essential, wisdom and sound judgment are also gifts from Him. Common sense, rooted in godly principles, helps us make choices that honor Him.

              God can use circumstances—open doors, closed opportunities, or providential events—to direct our paths. While not every situation is a "sign," God's sovereignty ensures that He works through life's details to guide us.

        <div class="mt-12 pt-8 border-t-2 border-black">
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            God graciously speaks to us in many ways—through His Word, His Spirit, His people, our God-given wisdom, and even the circumstances of life. Yet all these voices find their clarity and authority in the commanding Scripture. Without daily time in God's Word, we risk misinterpreting the Spirit's promptings, overlooking wise counsel, or misreading signs around us. By anchoring ourselves in Scripture each day, we train our hearts to recognize His voice in every other way He speaks, walking confidently in His guidance and growing deeper in relationship with Him.
